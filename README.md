# Moon-Board-Grader-Project
A program to classify Moon-Board routes using CNNs, for my university project.

This program was my submission for my final year dissertation. I tested a range image classification models and compared the results when attempting to classify Moon-Board routes by difficulty. I created my own CNN model and through a series of modifying and testing, and found the best model structure resulting in an accuracy of around 60% at the submission date. 

Additionally, I tested accuracy with different verisons of my dataset with some initial image manipulation. The three datasets are: Original, Greyscale, and removed background. The Dataset isn't hosted on this repository because of its size and to avoid any copyright issues with Moon-Board. The pre-processing code can be found in the ImageProcessing.ipynb file.

The whole development process of the project is detailed in the full report pdf.
